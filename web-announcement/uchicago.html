<p><strong>Where:</strong> <a href=http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Searle+Chemical+Laboratory++5735+South+Ellis+Avenue++Chicago,+IL+60637&hl=en&ll=41.790689,-87.600131&spn=0.009087,0.019205&client=safari&oe=UTF-8&hq=Searle+Chemical+Laboratory++5735+South+Ellis+Avenue++Chicago,+IL+60637&radius=15000&t=m&z=16&iwloc=A>University of Chicago, Searle-Cl 240.</a></p>
<p><strong>What:</strong> Our goal is to help scientists and engineers become more productive by teaching them basic computing skills like program design, version control, testing, and task automation. This two-day boot camp will feature short tutorials interspersed with hands-on practical exercises. Participants will be encouraged to help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems during and between sessions. There will be online follow up sessions for 6 to 8 weeks extending the material from the boot camp.</p>
<p><strong>Who:</strong> The course is aimed at graduate and undergraduate students, postdocs, and working scientists who are familiar with basic programming concepts (loops, conditionals, arrays,  functions, etc.) but need help to translate this knowledge into practical tools to help them work more productively.</p>
<p><strong><strong></strong>Requirements:</strong> Participants must bring a laptop with a few specific software packages installed (the list will be sent to participants a week before the boot camp).</p>
<p><strong>Content:</strong> <strong></strong>The syllabus for this boot camp will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Shell / BASH</li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Version Control</li>
<li>Testing</li>
<li>Debugging</li>
<li>Documentation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Registration:</strong> Please use the form below to register your interest. We strongly encourage learners to attend with colleagues, so feel free to create or join a team when you sign up. Ideally we would like teams of 3 to 6 members, and we will give preference to teams including one more knowledgeable member who is interested in organizing further training at their own institution. By registering you are stating that you will attend both days of the workshop and participate in the online exercises and follow-up sessions in the following weeks. We will notify all applicants as to whether they have a spot no later than March 26.</p>
